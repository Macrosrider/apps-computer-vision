# Geometry of Ellipse

WIP

Implementation is [ellipse.py](./ellipse.py).

See the results and graphs in [Ellipse](./Ellipse.ipynb) notebook.

## Task Description

Code an algorithm of finding ellipse from 6+ points. Show in graphs how the maximum deviation of output ellipse from expected ellipse depends on the standard deviation of the normally distributed errors of given points.
