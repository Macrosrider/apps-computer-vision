# Geometry of Ellipse

Implementation is [ellipse.py](./ellipse.py).

See the results and plots of experiments in [Ellipse](./Ellipse.ipynb) notebook.

## Task Description

Code an algorithm of finding ellipse from 6+ points. Make plots of how the maximum deviation of the obtained ellipse from ideal (ground truth) ellipse depends on the standard deviation of the normally distributed noise added to the input ellipse points.
